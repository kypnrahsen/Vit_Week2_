mkdir <>  >>make directory:Create a new directory in directory we are in 
touch <The name of file with extension>
echo <String i want to write> >  <The file name with extension>   :  The string is written in file
     *if i dont use file name ,the string is written in git bash
     *When i want to use again this command ;if i use just only one ">" between string and file name;
      file name would be deleted
and the new string would be written.If i use double">"  like ">>" ; this problem would be fixxed.
cat <the name of file with extension>: we can read the text inside file in git bash
